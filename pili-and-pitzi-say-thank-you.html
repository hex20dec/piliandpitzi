"I have a gift for you from the other side of the jungle!"</p><p>The parrot dropped a small package in front of Pili and Pitzi and flew away. The package was wrapped in bright green paper and had a red ribbon tied around it.</p><p>Pili and Pitzi were thrilled to receive a gift, but they weren't quite sure what to do next. They looked at each other, and Pili said, "We should open it!"</p><p>As they unwrapped the gift, they found a set of toy cars inside. They played with the cars for a while and had a great time. But as they finished playing, Pitzi looked at Pili and said, "We should say thank you to our friend for the gift."</p><p>Pili nodded in agreement, and they both knew that the right thing to do was to write a thank you note to their friend.</p><p>The next day, they found a piece of paper and some pencils and wrote a thank you note to the parrot. They thanked her for the gift and for being such a wonderful friend. They then rolled up the note and flew to the other side of the jungle to deliver it to their friend in person.</p><p>When they arrived at the parrot's tree, they found her playing with some other animals. Pili and Pitzi climbed up to her and handed her the note.</p><p>The parrot opened the note and read it aloud. She was so happy and touched by their gratitude that she started to cry.</p><p>"You're so welcome, Pili and Pitzi," the parrot said. "I'm so glad you liked the gift. And thank you for writing me such a sweet note."</p><p>From then on, Pili and Pitzi made sure to always write a thank you note or make a call to thank someone for a gift. They learned that showing gratitude and appreciation is important in maintaining strong and healthy relationships with others.</p><p>The end.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><footer class="post__footer"><div class="post__tag-share"><div class="post__share"></div></div></footer></div></article><div class="post__related"><h3 class="post__related__title">Related posts</h3><div class="l-grid l-grid--2"><article class="c-card"><div class="c-card__wrapper"><div class="c-card__content"><header><h2 class="c-card__title"><a href="https://hex20dec.github.io/piliandpitzi/pili-and-pitzis-jungle-adventure.html" class="invert">Pili and Pitzi&#x27;s Jungle Adventure</a></h2></header><footer class="c-card__meta"></footer></div></div></article><article class="c-card"><div class="c-card__wrapper"><div class="c-card__content"><header><h2 class="c-card__title"><a href="https://hex20dec.github.io/piliandpitzi/the-power-of-waiting-your-turn-a-story-with-pili-and-pitzi.html" class="invert">The Power of Waiting Your Turn: A Story with Pili and Pitzi</a></h2></header><footer class="c-card__meta"></footer></div></div></article></div></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__left"><div class="footer__copy"><p>Powered by Publii</p></div></div><button onclick="backToTopFunction()" id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg><use xlink:href="https://hex20dec.github.io/piliandpitzi/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = { mobileMenuMode: 'sidebar', animationSpeed: 300, submenuWidth: 'auto', doubleClickTime: 500, mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus: true, relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector: '.navbar', };</script><script defer="defer" src="https://hex20dec.github.io/piliandpitzi/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=8190bbfcf662a6d5bf1ad35d88ad1ec9"></script><script>function publiiDetectLoadedImages () {
