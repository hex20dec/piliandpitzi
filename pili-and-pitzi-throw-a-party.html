They had been planning and preparing for weeks to make sure everything was just perfect.</p><p>On the day of the party, Pili and Pitzi woke up early to start getting everything ready. They blew up balloons, set up decorations, and prepared the food. They were so excited to see all of their friends and celebrate Pitzi's special day.</p><p>As the party was scheduled to start at 1:00pm, Pili and Pitzi expected their friends to start arriving soon after. However, 1:00pm came and went, and no one had arrived yet. Pili and Pitzi started to worry that their friends wouldn't show up at all.</p><p>As the minutes ticked by, Pili and Pitzi started to feel more and more sad. They had put so much effort into the party and they just wanted their friends to be there to share it with them.</p><p>Finally, about half an hour late, their first friend arrived. Pili and Pitzi were so happy to see him, but they were also a little upset that he was so late. They tried not to show it and welcomed him warmly.</p><p>One by one, their friends arrived, each of them later than the last. Pili and Pitzi were happy to see each of them, but they couldn't help feeling disappointed that no one was on time.</p><p>After the last guest arrived, Pili and Pitzi thanked everyone for coming and handed out party hats and noisemakers. They all sang "Happy Birthday" and enjoyed some delicious cake and ice cream. Pili and Pitzi were happy that their friends had come, but they couldn't shake the feeling that it would have been even better if everyone had been on time.</p><p>As the party came to an end and their friends started to leave, Pili and Pitzi gathered them together. They thanked them for coming and told them how much they appreciated it, but they also explained how they had felt when everyone was late. They explained how important it is to be on time, especially when it's for a special occasion.</p><p>Their friends apologized and promised to be on time in the future. Pili and Pitzi forgave them and they all hugged each other goodbye. Pili and Pitzi were happy to have celebrated Pitzi's birthday with their friends, but they also learned a valuable lesson about the importance of being on time.</p><p>From that day on, Pili and Pitzi made sure to always be on time, whether it was for a party, school, or anything else. They didn't want to disappoint anyone the way they had been disappointed on Pitzi's birthday. And whenever they invited someone to an event, they made sure to stress the importance of being on time, so that everyone could have the best possible experience.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between"><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-3 md:gap-4 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible">Â </div><div>The End.</div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><footer class="post__footer"><div class="post__tag-share"><div class="post__share"></div></div></footer></div></article><div class="post__related"><h3 class="post__related__title">Related posts</h3><div class="l-grid l-grid--2"><article class="c-card"><div class="c-card__wrapper"><div class="c-card__content"><header><h2 class="c-card__title"><a href="https://hex20dec.github.io/piliandpitzi/pili-and-pitzis-jungle-adventure.html" class="invert">Pili and Pitzi&#x27;s Jungle Adventure</a></h2></header><footer class="c-card__meta"></footer></div></div></article><article class="c-card"><div class="c-card__wrapper"><div class="c-card__content"><header><h2 class="c-card__title"><a href="https://hex20dec.github.io/piliandpitzi/the-power-of-waiting-your-turn-a-story-with-pili-and-pitzi.html" class="invert">The Power of Waiting Your Turn: A Story with Pili and Pitzi</a></h2></header><footer class="c-card__meta"></footer></div></div></article></div></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__left"><div class="footer__copy"><p>Powered by Publii</p></div></div><button onclick="backToTopFunction()" id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg><use xlink:href="https://hex20dec.github.io/piliandpitzi/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = { mobileMenuMode: 'sidebar', animationSpeed: 300, submenuWidth: 'auto', doubleClickTime: 500, mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus: true, relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector: '.navbar', };</script><script defer="defer" src="https://hex20dec.github.io/piliandpitzi/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=8190bbfcf662a6d5bf1ad35d88ad1ec9"></script><script>function publiiDetectLoadedImages () {
