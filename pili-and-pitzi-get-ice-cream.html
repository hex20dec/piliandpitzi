Pili quickly ran to the door and held it open for the couple. They smiled and thanked him as they walked in.</p><p>Pitzi had noticed how happy the couple looked and realized how something as small as holding the door could make a big difference in someone's day. As they entered the ice cream shop, they saw that it was packed with people, and Pili and Pitzi realized that this could be a great opportunity to help people.</p><p>As they walked through the shop, Pili held the door for people coming in and out, while Pitzi tried to help people carrying heavy items. Pili and Pitzi's kind actions didn't go unnoticed, and soon people were thanking them left and right.</p><p>After they had gotten their ice cream, they noticed a little girl struggling to reach a napkin on the counter. Pitzi quickly ran to her and handed her a napkin, and the little girl smiled in gratitude.</p><p>Pili and Pitzi felt so good helping people that they continued to hold the door and help anyone who needed it. As they walked out of the ice cream shop, they realized that being polite is not just about holding the door for someone, it's also about showing kindness to others and making a difference in their day.</p><p>From that day on, Pili and Pitzi made it a habit to hold the door for others and to help people whenever they could. They knew that even a small act of kindness could make someone's day better, and that made them feel happy and proud.</p><p>As they walked home, Pili turned to Pitzi and said, "Helping others makes me feel good inside. I hope we can do it again sometime." Pitzi smiled and replied, "Me too, Pili. It's important to show kindness to others, and holding the door for them is such an easy way to do that."</p><p>Pili and Pitzi continued to practice this act of kindness everywhere they went, and soon it became a habit. They found that holding the door for others not only made them feel good, but it also made others feel happy and appreciated.</p><p>The End.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><footer class="post__footer"><div class="post__tag-share"><div class="post__share"></div></div></footer></div></article><div class="post__related"><h3 class="post__related__title">Related posts</h3><div class="l-grid l-grid--2"><article class="c-card"><div class="c-card__wrapper"><div class="c-card__content"><header><h2 class="c-card__title"><a href="https://hex20dec.github.io/piliandpitzi/pili-and-pitzis-jungle-adventure.html" class="invert">Pili and Pitzi&#x27;s Jungle Adventure</a></h2></header><footer class="c-card__meta"></footer></div></div></article><article class="c-card"><div class="c-card__wrapper"><div class="c-card__content"><header><h2 class="c-card__title"><a href="https://hex20dec.github.io/piliandpitzi/the-power-of-waiting-your-turn-a-story-with-pili-and-pitzi.html" class="invert">The Power of Waiting Your Turn: A Story with Pili and Pitzi</a></h2></header><footer class="c-card__meta"></footer></div></div></article></div></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__left"><div class="footer__copy"><p>Powered by Publii</p></div></div><button onclick="backToTopFunction()" id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg><use xlink:href="https://hex20dec.github.io/piliandpitzi/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = { mobileMenuMode: 'sidebar', animationSpeed: 300, submenuWidth: 'auto', doubleClickTime: 500, mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus: true, relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector: '.navbar', };</script><script defer="defer" src="https://hex20dec.github.io/piliandpitzi/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=8190bbfcf662a6d5bf1ad35d88ad1ec9"></script><script>function publiiDetectLoadedImages () {
