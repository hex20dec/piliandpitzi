She had practiced for weeks, even staying up late at night to perfect her moves. On the day of the show, her parents and Pili, her best friend, came to watch her dance.</p><p>Pitzi and her family arrived early and found their seats in the front row. Soon, the auditorium was filled with the parents, family members, and friends of the ballet students. Pili was also excited for Pitzi's performance, but she was not looking forward to sitting through the entire show.</p><p>The show started with the youngest students performing. Pili tried her best to show interest and applaud when appropriate, but she found the dances boring and wished the show would end soon. Pitzi, on the other hand, was transfixed by the performance. She clapped and cheered with excitement, admiring the young dancers' dedication and hard work.</p><p>As the show progressed, the dances became more complex, and the music more enchanting. Pili found herself being drawn into the rhythm and grace of the dancers. Pitzi was thrilled to see her friends and classmates perform, and she was amazed by the beauty of the show. They were both having a great time, but Pili realized that her initial boredom was unfair to the performers and presenters who had worked so hard to put on the show.</p><p>By the time Pitzi's turn came, Pili was a changed person. She was beaming with excitement, clapping and cheering as Pitzi danced her heart out. Pitzi noticed her friend's enthusiasm and was happy to see her enjoying the show. After the performance, Pitzi was greeted with a standing ovation from the audience.</p><p>As they walked out of the auditorium, Pitzi thanked Pili for being such a supportive friend. Pili apologized for not showing enthusiasm earlier and promised to always appreciate the hard work and dedication of performers and presenters. Pitzi was proud of her friend's newfound appreciation and promised to do the same at her next school play.</p><p>When they got home, Pitzi's parents congratulated her on her excellent performance. Pili also shared with Pitzi's grandparents how she had learned to sit through an event quietly and show interest, even if it was not her favorite thing to do. They were all impressed with the girls' display of maturity and agreed that showing respect for others' hard work was essential in life.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between"><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-3 md:gap-4 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible">Â </div></div></div></div></div><div class="w-full h-32 md:h-48 flex-shrink-0">The End.</div></div></div></div></div></div><footer class="post__footer"><div class="post__tag-share"><div class="post__share"></div></div></footer></div></article><div class="post__related"><h3 class="post__related__title">Related posts</h3><div class="l-grid l-grid--2"><article class="c-card"><div class="c-card__wrapper"><div class="c-card__content"><header><h2 class="c-card__title"><a href="https://hex20dec.github.io/piliandpitzi/pili-and-pitzi-show-gratitude.html" class="invert">Pili and Pitzi Show Gratitude</a></h2></header><footer class="c-card__meta"></footer></div></div></article></div></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__left"><div class="footer__copy"><p>Powered by Publii</p></div></div><button onclick="backToTopFunction()" id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg><use xlink:href="https://hex20dec.github.io/piliandpitzi/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = { mobileMenuMode: 'sidebar', animationSpeed: 300, submenuWidth: 'auto', doubleClickTime: 500, mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus: true, relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector: '.navbar', };</script><script defer="defer" src="https://hex20dec.github.io/piliandpitzi/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=8190bbfcf662a6d5bf1ad35d88ad1ec9"></script><script>function publiiDetectLoadedImages () {
