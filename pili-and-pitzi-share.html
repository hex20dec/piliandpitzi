They were learning about animals and nature, and the lesson was so much fun.</p><p>After a while, Pili's stomach began to grumble. "I'm getting hungry," he said to Pitzi. "Are you hungry too?"</p><p>Pitzi checked her lunchbox and smiled. "I have a lot of grapes today," she said. "And you?"</p><p>"I have a peanut butter and jelly sandwich," Pili said.</p><p>The two friends went to the cafeteria to eat. They sat down at a table and began to unpack their lunches.</p><p>As they ate, they noticed that their friend Ella was sitting alone at a nearby table. She looked sad and didn't have any lunch with her.</p><p>Pitzi felt bad for Ella and whispered to Pili, "Hey, let's offer her some of our food."</p><p>Pili nodded in agreement, and they walked over to Ella's table. "Hey Ella, do you want some of our lunch?" asked Pili.</p><p>Ella smiled and nodded gratefully. "Thank you so much," she said.</p><p>Pitzi shared some of her grapes with Ella, and Pili shared his sandwich. They all chatted and laughed together while they ate.</p><p>After they finished eating, Ella thanked Pili and Pitzi for their kindness. "You guys are such good friends," she said.</p><p>Pili and Pitzi felt happy knowing they had made Ella's day a little bit better. They also learned that it's always a good idea to offer to share your food with someone who may not have any.</p><p>The next day, Pili and Pitzi came to school with extra snacks in their lunchboxes. They made it a habit to share their food with anyone who was hungry and alone at lunchtime. They even encouraged their other friends to do the same.</p><p>Their kindness and generosity soon became contagious, and soon many other students in the school were sharing their food and making new friends.</p><p>Pili and Pitzi were proud of what they had started. They knew that a small act of kindness can go a long way.</p><p>From that day on, Pili and Pitzi made it a point to always offer to share their food, especially with those who were less fortunate. They knew that it was the right thing to do, and it made them feel happy and fulfilled.</p><p>The end.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><footer class="post__footer"><div class="post__tag-share"><div class="post__share"></div></div></footer></div></article><div class="post__related"><h3 class="post__related__title">Related posts</h3><div class="l-grid l-grid--2"><article class="c-card"><div class="c-card__wrapper"><div class="c-card__content"><header><h2 class="c-card__title"><a href="https://hex20dec.github.io/piliandpitzi/pili-and-pitzis-jungle-adventure.html" class="invert">Pili and Pitzi&#x27;s Jungle Adventure</a></h2></header><footer class="c-card__meta"></footer></div></div></article><article class="c-card"><div class="c-card__wrapper"><div class="c-card__content"><header><h2 class="c-card__title"><a href="https://hex20dec.github.io/piliandpitzi/the-power-of-waiting-your-turn-a-story-with-pili-and-pitzi.html" class="invert">The Power of Waiting Your Turn: A Story with Pili and Pitzi</a></h2></header><footer class="c-card__meta"></footer></div></div></article></div></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__left"><div class="footer__copy"><p>Powered by Publii</p></div></div><button onclick="backToTopFunction()" id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg><use xlink:href="https://hex20dec.github.io/piliandpitzi/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = { mobileMenuMode: 'sidebar', animationSpeed: 300, submenuWidth: 'auto', doubleClickTime: 500, mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus: true, relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector: '.navbar', };</script><script defer="defer" src="https://hex20dec.github.io/piliandpitzi/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=8190bbfcf662a6d5bf1ad35d88ad1ec9"></script><script>function publiiDetectLoadedImages () {
