As they sat down at their table, Pili reached for her napkin and placed it on her lap. Pitzi, on the other hand, just sat there, looking around in awe at the elegant atmosphere of the restaurant.</p><p>Pili noticed Pitzi's hesitation and leaned over to whisper in her ear, "Don't forget to put your napkin in your lap, remember we learned it's a sign of good manners."</p><p>Pitzi quickly grabbed her napkin and placed it on her lap. "Thanks for reminding me, Pili," she said, feeling happy she had such a nice friend.</p><p>As they perused the menu, Pili explained to Pitzi that placing the napkin in your lap is not only polite, but it also helps keep yourself clean. "It's important to remember these little things, especially when you're in a fancy place," she added.</p><p>After reading the menu, Pili ordered a delicious pasta dish while Pitzi ordered a pizza with all her favorite toppings. As they waited for their food to arrive, Pili and Pitzi talked about how excited they were to try the food and how much they loved going out to eat.</p><p>When the food arrived, Pili and Pitzi were both impressed with the presentation and could hardly wait to dig in. But before they started eating, they remembered to give thanks for the food they were about to eat.</p><p>They took their first bites and savored the flavors. They chewed with their mouths closed, remembering yet another lesson they had learned. They couldn't help but notice how good the food tasted and how much they were enjoying their meal.</p><p>During the meal, Pili and Pitzi enjoyed their food and the elegant ambiance of the restaurant. They used their napkins to wipe their mouths and hands, and placed them back on their laps between bites. Pili also showed Pitzi how to fold her napkin neatly at the end of the meal, as a sign of appreciation to the restaurant.</p><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap"><div class="markdown prose w-full break-words dark:prose-invert light"><p>As they finished their meal, Pili and Pitzi remembered one last lesson they had learned: always thank your host or the restaurant staff. They called over their waiter and complimented the food and the service they had received. The waiter was very grateful and thanked them for their kind words.</p><p>As they left the restaurant, Pili and Pitzi felt happy and satisfied, not just because they had enjoyed a delicious meal, but because they had followed the lessons their mother had taught them. They knew that good manners and showing gratitude were important in life, and they made a promise to always remember these lessons.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="w-full border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 group bg-gray-50 dark:bg-[#444654]"><div class="text-base gap-4 md:gap-6 m-auto md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-2xl xl:max-w-3xl p-4 md:py-6 flex lg:px-0"><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex justify-between"><div> </div><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-3 md:gap-4 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible">The End. </div></div></div></div></div><div class="w-full h-32 md:h-48 flex-shrink-0"> </div></div></div></div></div></div><footer class="post__footer"><div class="post__tag-share"><div class="post__share"></div></div></footer></div></article><div class="post__related"><h3 class="post__related__title">Related posts</h3><div class="l-grid l-grid--2"><article class="c-card"><div class="c-card__wrapper"><div class="c-card__content"><header><h2 class="c-card__title"><a href="https://hex20dec.github.io/piliandpitzi/pili-and-pitzis-jungle-adventure.html" class="invert">Pili and Pitzi&#x27;s Jungle Adventure</a></h2></header><footer class="c-card__meta"></footer></div></div></article><article class="c-card"><div class="c-card__wrapper"><div class="c-card__content"><header><h2 class="c-card__title"><a href="https://hex20dec.github.io/piliandpitzi/the-power-of-waiting-your-turn-a-story-with-pili-and-pitzi.html" class="invert">The Power of Waiting Your Turn: A Story with Pili and Pitzi</a></h2></header><footer class="c-card__meta"></footer></div></div></article></div></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__left"><div class="footer__copy"><p>Powered by Publii</p></div></div><button onclick="backToTopFunction()" id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg><use xlink:href="https://hex20dec.github.io/piliandpitzi/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = { mobileMenuMode: 'sidebar', animationSpeed: 300, submenuWidth: 'auto', doubleClickTime: 500, mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus: true, relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector: '.navbar', };</script><script defer="defer" src="https://hex20dec.github.io/piliandpitzi/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=8190bbfcf662a6d5bf1ad35d88ad1ec9"></script><script>function publiiDetectLoadedImages () {
