Zara had decorated her house with balloons and streamers and had prepared delicious treats for her guests.</p><p>As soon as they arrived, Pili and Pitzi were amazed by how beautiful Zara's home looked. They were so excited to be there that they quickly ran to the living room and started playing with some toys that Zara had brought out.</p><p>After a while, they started to get a little hungry, so they went to the kitchen to grab some snacks. As they were eating, Pili accidentally spilled some crumbs on the floor. Pitzi noticed and said, "Pili, you spilled some crumbs on the floor. We should clean them up so we don't leave a mess for Zara."</p><p>Pili felt embarrassed that she had made a mess, but she was grateful for Pitzi's reminder. They quickly got some paper towels and cleaned up the crumbs.</p><p>As the party continued, Pili and Pitzi noticed that some of the other guests were leaving their plates and cups all over the place. Pili and Pitzi felt like they should do something, but they didn't want to be rude.</p><p>Pitzi whispered to Pili, "I think we should clean up after the other guests. That way, Zara doesn't have to do it herself."</p><p>Pili agreed, and they began picking up the plates and cups that were left around the house. They even helped put away some of the decorations.</p><p>Zara noticed what Pili and Pitzi were doing and said, "Thank you both so much for helping me clean up. You didn't have to do that, but I really appreciate it."</p><p>Pili and Pitzi smiled and said, "We're happy to help. We don't want to leave a mess for you."</p><p>Zara smiled and said, "You two are such great guests. I wish everyone was as thoughtful as you."</p><p>Pili and Pitzi felt proud of themselves for being polite and respectful guests. They learned that when you're in someone else's home, it's important to be respectful by cleaning up after yourself and helping out when you can. And they were glad they could help make Zara's party a success.</p><p>From that day on, Pili and Pitzi made sure to clean up after themselves wherever they went, and they always offered to help out their hosts. They knew that being considerate and respectful was the best way to show their gratitude for being invited to someone else's home.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><footer class="post__footer"><div class="post__tag-share"><div class="post__share"></div></div></footer></div></article><div class="post__related"><h3 class="post__related__title">Related posts</h3><div class="l-grid l-grid--2"><article class="c-card"><div class="c-card__wrapper"><div class="c-card__content"><header><h2 class="c-card__title"><a href="https://hex20dec.github.io/piliandpitzi/pili-and-pitzis-jungle-adventure.html" class="invert">Pili and Pitzi&#x27;s Jungle Adventure</a></h2></header><footer class="c-card__meta"></footer></div></div></article><article class="c-card"><div class="c-card__wrapper"><div class="c-card__content"><header><h2 class="c-card__title"><a href="https://hex20dec.github.io/piliandpitzi/the-power-of-waiting-your-turn-a-story-with-pili-and-pitzi.html" class="invert">The Power of Waiting Your Turn: A Story with Pili and Pitzi</a></h2></header><footer class="c-card__meta"></footer></div></div></article></div></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__left"><div class="footer__copy"><p>Powered by Publii</p></div></div><button onclick="backToTopFunction()" id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg><use xlink:href="https://hex20dec.github.io/piliandpitzi/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = { mobileMenuMode: 'sidebar', animationSpeed: 300, submenuWidth: 'auto', doubleClickTime: 500, mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus: true, relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector: '.navbar', };</script><script defer="defer" src="https://hex20dec.github.io/piliandpitzi/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=8190bbfcf662a6d5bf1ad35d88ad1ec9"></script><script>function publiiDetectLoadedImages () {
