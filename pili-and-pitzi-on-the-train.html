As they squeezed into their seats, they noticed that there were a lot of people standing, holding onto poles or leaning against the walls. They saw an elderly woman holding onto a pole with a look of exhaustion on her face.</p><p>Pili looked at Pitzi and whispered, "She looks like she could use a seat."</p><p>Pitzi nodded and looked around. All the other seats were taken, so she stood up and tapped the woman on the arm. "Excuse me," she said, "would you like to sit down? You look tired."</p><p>The woman smiled gratefully and sat down, thanking Pitzi for her kindness. Pili and Pitzi felt good about their action, knowing they had helped someone in need.</p><p>As they continued their journey, they noticed other people on the train who could benefit from a seat, like a man using crutches. Pili stood up and offered the man her seat. Pili and Pitzi made a mental note to keep an eye out and offer their seats whenever possible.</p><div class="flex-1 overflow-hidden"><div class="react-scroll-to-bottom--css-yirjv-79elbk h-full dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="react-scroll-to-bottom--css-yirjv-1n7m0yu"><div class="flex flex-col items-center text-sm dark:bg-gray-800"><div class="w-full border-b border-black/10 dark:border-gray-900/50 text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 group bg-gray-50 dark:bg-[#444654]"><div class="text-base gap-4 md:gap-6 m-auto md:max-w-2xl lg:max-w-2xl xl:max-w-3xl p-4 md:py-6 flex lg:px-0"><div class="relative flex w-[calc(100%-50px)] flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3 lg:w-[calc(100%-115px)]"><div class="flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3"><div class="min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-4 whitespace-pre-wrap"><div class="markdown prose w-full break-words dark:prose-invert light"><p>As the train pulled into the station, Pili and Pitzi made their way to Pili's grandparent's house. Excited to see them, they burst through the front door with big smiles on their faces.</p><p>Pili's grandparents greeted them warmly, and the friends eagerly shared their story of how they offered their seats to people on the train. Their grandparents were impressed and proud of their kind actions.</p><p>Grandma took Pili and Pitzi aside and talked to them about how important it is to be considerate of others, especially those who may need a little extra help. She shared stories of her own experiences on public transportation and how grateful she was when someone offered her a seat.</p><p>Pitzi listened intently, realizing how their small act of kindness had made such a big impact on the elderly couple. He felt a sense of pride knowing that they had made someone's day a little easier and more comfortable.</p><p>From that day on, Pili and Pitzi made it a point to always be aware of those around them and offer their seats whenever necessary. They knew that it was just a small gesture, but it could make a huge difference in someone's day. And, every time they did it, they felt a sense of satisfaction and joy knowing that they were doing something good for someone else.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between"><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-3 md:gap-4 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible">Â </div><div>The End.</div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><footer class="post__footer"><div class="post__tag-share"><div class="post__share"></div></div></footer></div></article><div class="post__related"><h3 class="post__related__title">Related posts</h3><div class="l-grid l-grid--2"><article class="c-card"><div class="c-card__wrapper"><div class="c-card__content"><header><h2 class="c-card__title"><a href="https://hex20dec.github.io/piliandpitzi/pili-and-pitzis-jungle-adventure.html" class="invert">Pili and Pitzi&#x27;s Jungle Adventure</a></h2></header><footer class="c-card__meta"></footer></div></div></article><article class="c-card"><div class="c-card__wrapper"><div class="c-card__content"><header><h2 class="c-card__title"><a href="https://hex20dec.github.io/piliandpitzi/the-power-of-waiting-your-turn-a-story-with-pili-and-pitzi.html" class="invert">The Power of Waiting Your Turn: A Story with Pili and Pitzi</a></h2></header><footer class="c-card__meta"></footer></div></div></article></div></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__left"><div class="footer__copy"><p>Powered by Publii</p></div></div><button onclick="backToTopFunction()" id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg><use xlink:href="https://hex20dec.github.io/piliandpitzi/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = { mobileMenuMode: 'sidebar', animationSpeed: 300, submenuWidth: 'auto', doubleClickTime: 500, mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus: true, relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector: '.navbar', };</script><script defer="defer" src="https://hex20dec.github.io/piliandpitzi/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=8190bbfcf662a6d5bf1ad35d88ad1ec9"></script><script>function publiiDetectLoadedImages () {
