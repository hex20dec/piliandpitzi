As they packed their bags, Pili remembered something important.</p><p>“Pitzi, do you remember the last time we borrowed that backpack from our friend Hati? We never returned it,” Pili said.</p><p>“Oh, no! You’re right. We need to go return it before we go on our adventure,” Pitzi replied.</p><p>So, the two friends made their way to Hati’s house to return the borrowed backpack. When they arrived, Hati was happy to see them but also surprised.</p><p>“Pili, Pitzi! It’s so great to see you! What brings you here today?” Hati asked.</p><p>“We came to return the backpack we borrowed from you. We’re sorry we kept it for so long,” Pili said.</p><p>Hati smiled and said, “It’s no problem at all, but thank you for bringing it back.”</p><p>As Pili and Pitzi left Hati’s house, they felt relieved and proud of themselves for being responsible and returning what they had borrowed.</p><p>As they made their way to the cave, they couldn’t help but think about how important it is to always return things you’ve borrowed. It’s not only polite, but it shows that you are responsible and can be trusted.</p><p>Once they arrived at the cave, Pili and Pitzi made sure to take good care of their own backpack and avoid damaging anything in the cave. They explored the cave carefully and made sure to leave it just as they found it.</p><p>As they made their way out of the cave, Pili and Pitzi were happy and fulfilled from their adventure. They knew that by returning things they borrowed, they could continue to go on more adventures and make more memories with their friends.</p><p>From that day on, Pili and Pitzi made sure to always return things they borrowed. They understood that being responsible and trustworthy was important, not just for them but for everyone they interacted with.</p><p>The end.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><footer class="post__footer"><div class="post__tag-share"><div class="post__share"></div></div></footer></div></article><div class="post__related"><h3 class="post__related__title">Related posts</h3><div class="l-grid l-grid--2"><article class="c-card"><div class="c-card__wrapper"><div class="c-card__content"><header><h2 class="c-card__title"><a href="https://hex20dec.github.io/piliandpitzi/pili-and-pitzis-jungle-adventure.html" class="invert">Pili and Pitzi&#x27;s Jungle Adventure</a></h2></header><footer class="c-card__meta"></footer></div></div></article><article class="c-card"><div class="c-card__wrapper"><div class="c-card__content"><header><h2 class="c-card__title"><a href="https://hex20dec.github.io/piliandpitzi/the-power-of-waiting-your-turn-a-story-with-pili-and-pitzi.html" class="invert">The Power of Waiting Your Turn: A Story with Pili and Pitzi</a></h2></header><footer class="c-card__meta"></footer></div></div></article></div></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__left"><div class="footer__copy"><p>Powered by Publii</p></div></div><button onclick="backToTopFunction()" id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg><use xlink:href="https://hex20dec.github.io/piliandpitzi/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = { mobileMenuMode: 'sidebar', animationSpeed: 300, submenuWidth: 'auto', doubleClickTime: 500, mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus: true, relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector: '.navbar', };</script><script defer="defer" src="https://hex20dec.github.io/piliandpitzi/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=8190bbfcf662a6d5bf1ad35d88ad1ec9"></script><script>function publiiDetectLoadedImages () {
