As they ate, they noticed that their Pili's brother, Pipo, was chomping on his food with his mouth wide open. They could see the meatball rolling from side to side in his mouth!</p><p>Pili and Pitzi cringed at the sight and their friends noticed the chomping too. "Pipo, please remember to chew with your mouth closed," Pili reminded him gently.</p><p>Pipo tried to follow his sister's advice, but found it difficult. "But it's hard to eat like that," he complained.</p><p>Pili and Pitzi decided to take it upon themselves to teach Pipo the proper way to chew. They demonstrated for him, and even though it felt strange to chew with their mouths closed at first, they quickly got used to it.</p><p>"See, it's not so bad, Pipo," Pitzi said encouragingly. "And it's much more polite to eat with your mouth closed. Nobody wants to see all the food in your mouth."</p><p>Pipo nodded and tried again. With a little practice, he got the hang of it, and even seemed to enjoy his meal more.</p><p>From then on, whenever they sat down for a meal, Pili and Pitzi made sure to remind Pipo to chew with his mouth closed. It became a habit for him, and he no longer received reminders from his family.</p><p>The lesson Pili and Pitzi had taught their little brother stuck with them too. They made sure to chew with their mouths closed and even reminded their parents to do the same. It made mealtime much more enjoyable for everyone, and it was one more way they could show respect and consideration for others.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between"> </div></div></div></div><div class="w-full h-32 md:h-48 flex-shrink-0"> </div><div>The End. </div></div></div></div></div></div><footer class="post__footer"><div class="post__tag-share"><div class="post__share"></div></div></footer></div></article><div class="post__related"><h3 class="post__related__title">Related posts</h3><div class="l-grid l-grid--2"><article class="c-card"><div class="c-card__wrapper"><div class="c-card__content"><header><h2 class="c-card__title"><a href="https://hex20dec.github.io/piliandpitzi/pili-and-pitzis-jungle-adventure.html" class="invert">Pili and Pitzi&#x27;s Jungle Adventure</a></h2></header><footer class="c-card__meta"></footer></div></div></article><article class="c-card"><div class="c-card__wrapper"><div class="c-card__content"><header><h2 class="c-card__title"><a href="https://hex20dec.github.io/piliandpitzi/the-power-of-waiting-your-turn-a-story-with-pili-and-pitzi.html" class="invert">The Power of Waiting Your Turn: A Story with Pili and Pitzi</a></h2></header><footer class="c-card__meta"></footer></div></div></article></div></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__left"><div class="footer__copy"><p>Powered by Publii</p></div></div><button onclick="backToTopFunction()" id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg><use xlink:href="https://hex20dec.github.io/piliandpitzi/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = { mobileMenuMode: 'sidebar', animationSpeed: 300, submenuWidth: 'auto', doubleClickTime: 500, mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus: true, relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector: '.navbar', };</script><script defer="defer" src="https://hex20dec.github.io/piliandpitzi/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=8190bbfcf662a6d5bf1ad35d88ad1ec9"></script><script>function publiiDetectLoadedImages () {
