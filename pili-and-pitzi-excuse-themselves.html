They had planned to meet at a fancy restaurant that was well-known for its delicious food. As they sat down at the table, they noticed the many different forks, spoons, and knives set out in front of them. Pili and Pitzi looked at each other, unsure which utensil to use first.</p><p>Their friend, a wise owl, noticed their confusion and said, "Don't worry, just start from the outside and work your way in."</p><p>Pili and Pitzi followed the owl's advice and began eating their appetizers, which were incredibly tasty. However, in the middle of their meal, Pili suddenly felt an urgent need to use the restroom. She didn't want to make a scene or be rude, so she quietly said, "Please excuse me for a moment" and got up from the table.</p><p>As she walked away, she noticed that other people in the restaurant were also using the same phrase when they left their tables. Pili realized that this was a polite and considerate way of excusing oneself from the table.</p><p>After a few moments, Pili returned to the table and resumed eating her meal. As they finished their food, Pili and Pitzi's friends suggested trying the dessert, which was their restaurant's specialty.</p><p>To their excitement, the dessert was delicious, and they both loved it. Pili and Pitzi realized that sometimes it's good to try new things and not make negative comments about them before giving them a chance. They also remembered that it's essential to show consideration and respect to others while dining out.</p><p>As they left the restaurant, Pili and Pitzi thanked their friends for the lovely evening and promised to use the phrase "Please excuse me for a moment" whenever they needed to leave the table in the future.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between"><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-3 md:gap-4 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"> </div><div>The End. </div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><footer class="post__footer"><div class="post__tag-share"><div class="post__share"></div></div></footer></div></article><div class="post__related"><h3 class="post__related__title">Related posts</h3><div class="l-grid l-grid--2"><article class="c-card"><div class="c-card__wrapper"><div class="c-card__content"><header><h2 class="c-card__title"><a href="https://hex20dec.github.io/piliandpitzi/pili-and-pitzis-jungle-adventure.html" class="invert">Pili and Pitzi&#x27;s Jungle Adventure</a></h2></header><footer class="c-card__meta"></footer></div></div></article><article class="c-card"><div class="c-card__wrapper"><div class="c-card__content"><header><h2 class="c-card__title"><a href="https://hex20dec.github.io/piliandpitzi/the-power-of-waiting-your-turn-a-story-with-pili-and-pitzi.html" class="invert">The Power of Waiting Your Turn: A Story with Pili and Pitzi</a></h2></header><footer class="c-card__meta"></footer></div></div></article></div></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__left"><div class="footer__copy"><p>Powered by Publii</p></div></div><button onclick="backToTopFunction()" id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg><use xlink:href="https://hex20dec.github.io/piliandpitzi/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = { mobileMenuMode: 'sidebar', animationSpeed: 300, submenuWidth: 'auto', doubleClickTime: 500, mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus: true, relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector: '.navbar', };</script><script defer="defer" src="https://hex20dec.github.io/piliandpitzi/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=8190bbfcf662a6d5bf1ad35d88ad1ec9"></script><script>function publiiDetectLoadedImages () {
