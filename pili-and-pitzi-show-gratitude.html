They had a lot to be grateful for, and they knew it. One day, Pili woke up early in the morning and decided to take a walk in the jungle to enjoy the fresh air.</p><p>Pitzi was still sleeping when Pili left, so Pili decided to take the time to thank God for everything she had in her life. She looked around at the beautiful jungle and felt overwhelmed with gratitude.</p><p>"Thank you, God, for this beautiful jungle, the fresh air, and the warm sun," Pili said. "Thank you for my wonderful friend Pitzi and for all the other animals that call this jungle home."</p><p>As she continued her walk, she thought about all the other things she was thankful for, like her family, her health, and the food she had to eat. She knew that she was blessed in so many ways.</p><p>When Pili returned to her home, she found Pitzi awake and ready to start the day. Pitzi asked Pili where she had been, and Pili shared her experience of thanking God for everything she had.</p><p>Pitzi thought that was a great idea, so they decided to start their day by thanking God for everything they had.</p><p>"Thank you, God, for this beautiful day," Pitzi said. "Thank you for my wonderful friend Pili and for all the adventures we get to have together."</p><p>"Thank you, God, for our home, our food, and our health," Pili said. "And thank you for all the amazing opportunities we get to experience."</p><p>As they finished their morning prayer, they both felt a sense of peace and contentment. They knew that no matter what the day would bring, they were grateful for all they had.</p><p>From that day on, Pili and Pitzi made it a habit to start each day by thanking God for everything they had. They knew that even in tough times, there was always something to be grateful for, and that gratitude would help them to have a more positive outlook on life.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><footer class="post__footer"><div class="post__tag-share"><div class="post__share"></div></div></footer></div></article><div class="post__related"><h3 class="post__related__title">Related posts</h3><div class="l-grid l-grid--2"><article class="c-card"><div class="c-card__wrapper"><div class="c-card__content"><header><h2 class="c-card__title"><a href="https://hex20dec.github.io/piliandpitzi/pili-and-pitzis-jungle-adventure.html" class="invert">Pili and Pitzi&#x27;s Jungle Adventure</a></h2></header><footer class="c-card__meta"></footer></div></div></article><article class="c-card"><div class="c-card__wrapper"><div class="c-card__content"><header><h2 class="c-card__title"><a href="https://hex20dec.github.io/piliandpitzi/the-power-of-waiting-your-turn-a-story-with-pili-and-pitzi.html" class="invert">The Power of Waiting Your Turn: A Story with Pili and Pitzi</a></h2></header><footer class="c-card__meta"></footer></div></div></article></div></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__left"><div class="footer__copy"><p>Powered by Publii</p></div></div><button onclick="backToTopFunction()" id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg><use xlink:href="https://hex20dec.github.io/piliandpitzi/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = { mobileMenuMode: 'sidebar', animationSpeed: 300, submenuWidth: 'auto', doubleClickTime: 500, mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus: true, relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector: '.navbar', };</script><script defer="defer" src="https://hex20dec.github.io/piliandpitzi/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=8190bbfcf662a6d5bf1ad35d88ad1ec9"></script><script>function publiiDetectLoadedImages () {
