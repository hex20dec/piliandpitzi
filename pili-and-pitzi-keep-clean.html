They looked around to try and find the source of the odor, but couldn't seem to identify it.</p><p>As they were wandering, they stumbled upon their friend, a skunk named Skippy. Skippy greeted them with a smile, but Pili and Pitzi could barely stand the stench. They tried their best to hide their discomfort, but they couldn't help but wonder if Skippy was aware of his odor.</p><p>Pitzi turned to Pili and whispered, "Do you think we should tell Skippy about his smell?"</p><p>Pili replied, "I think we should. Maybe he doesn't realize how bad it is."</p><p>They approached Skippy and said, "Hey Skippy, can we talk to you for a moment?"</p><p>"Sure," Skippy replied. "What's up?"</p><p>Pili spoke up, "We wanted to talk to you about your hygiene. We couldn't help but notice that you have a strong odor."</p><p>Skippy looked embarrassed and replied, "Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't realize it was that bad."</p><p>"It's okay," Pitzi said. "But it's important to pay attention to your hygiene. Bad hygiene can make it difficult for people to be around you."</p><p>Skippy nodded in agreement and thanked Pili and Pitzi for bringing it to his attention. He promised to take a shower before going out again in the future.</p><p>From that day on, Skippy made sure to clean himself regularly, and Pili and Pitzi could tell the difference. They enjoyed spending time with him even more, now that the stench was gone.</p><p>Pili and Pitzi learned that paying attention to your hygiene is important, not just for your own health and well-being, but also for the comfort of those around you. They made a promise to always take good care of themselves, and to gently remind their friends to do the same.</p><p>As they walked through the jungle, Pili and Pitzi breathed in the fresh, clean air, and talked about the different ways they take care of their personal hygiene. Pili explained that elephants love taking mud baths to clean themselves, but they also make sure to take a shower with water and soap to get rid of any remaining dirt. Pitzi, on the other hand, explained that mice love to groom themselves by licking their fur clean. They also make sure to brush their teeth regularly to keep their breath fresh and their teeth healthy. Pili and Pitzi agreed that taking care of their personal hygiene was not only important for their health, but also for making a good impression on others. </p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between"><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-3 md:gap-4 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"> </div><div>The End.</div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><footer class="post__footer"><div class="post__tag-share"><div class="post__share"></div></div></footer></div></article><div class="post__related"><h3 class="post__related__title">Related posts</h3><div class="l-grid l-grid--2"><article class="c-card"><div class="c-card__wrapper"><div class="c-card__content"><header><h2 class="c-card__title"><a href="https://hex20dec.github.io/piliandpitzi/pili-and-pitzis-jungle-adventure.html" class="invert">Pili and Pitzi&#x27;s Jungle Adventure</a></h2></header><footer class="c-card__meta"></footer></div></div></article><article class="c-card"><div class="c-card__wrapper"><div class="c-card__content"><header><h2 class="c-card__title"><a href="https://hex20dec.github.io/piliandpitzi/the-power-of-waiting-your-turn-a-story-with-pili-and-pitzi.html" class="invert">The Power of Waiting Your Turn: A Story with Pili and Pitzi</a></h2></header><footer class="c-card__meta"></footer></div></div></article></div></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__left"><div class="footer__copy"><p>Powered by Publii</p></div></div><button onclick="backToTopFunction()" id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg><use xlink:href="https://hex20dec.github.io/piliandpitzi/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = { mobileMenuMode: 'sidebar', animationSpeed: 300, submenuWidth: 'auto', doubleClickTime: 500, mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus: true, relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector: '.navbar', };</script><script defer="defer" src="https://hex20dec.github.io/piliandpitzi/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=8190bbfcf662a6d5bf1ad35d88ad1ec9"></script><script>function publiiDetectLoadedImages () {
