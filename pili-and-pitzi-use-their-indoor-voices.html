One day, they were invited to a party at their friend's house, and they were very excited to attend. They dressed up in their best outfits and set out for the party.</p><p>When they arrived, they found that the house was filled with their animal friends, and everyone was having a great time. However, Pili quickly noticed that Pitzi was speaking very loudly and it was starting to get hard to hear each other over the noise.</p><p>Pili leaned over to Pitzi and whispered, "Pitzi, I think you're speaking too loudly. Can you try to use your indoor voice?"</p><p>Pitzi was a little embarrassed but agreed with Pili. "Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't even realize I was being loud. I'll try to speak more softly from now on."</p><p>Pili thanked Pitzi and together, they made an effort to use their indoor voices and set an example for the other animals. But, some of their friends were still speaking too loudly, so Pili and Pitzi politely reminded them to use their indoor voices.</p><p>"Excuse me," said Pili. "I don't mean to interrupt, but it's getting pretty loud in here. Would you mind speaking a little more softly?"</p><p>Their friends were surprised at first, but they quickly realized that they had been speaking too loudly and began to adjust their volume.</p><p>As the night went on, the party became much more enjoyable for everyone, and they could hear each other speak without any difficulty. Pili and Pitzi felt proud of themselves for helping to create a more comfortable and pleasant atmosphere at the party.</p><p>From that day on, Pitzi made a conscious effort to use her indoor voice when she was indoors. She realized that speaking too loudly not only made it difficult for others to hear, but it could also be seen as rude. Pili was proud of Pitzi for making the effort, and the two friends continued to have fun and enjoy their time together in a considerate and polite way.</p><p>The End.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><footer class="post__footer"><div class="post__tag-share"><div class="post__share"></div></div></footer></div></article><div class="post__related"><h3 class="post__related__title">Related posts</h3><div class="l-grid l-grid--2"><article class="c-card"><div class="c-card__wrapper"><div class="c-card__content"><header><h2 class="c-card__title"><a href="https://hex20dec.github.io/piliandpitzi/pili-and-pitzis-jungle-adventure.html" class="invert">Pili and Pitzi&#x27;s Jungle Adventure</a></h2></header><footer class="c-card__meta"></footer></div></div></article><article class="c-card"><div class="c-card__wrapper"><div class="c-card__content"><header><h2 class="c-card__title"><a href="https://hex20dec.github.io/piliandpitzi/the-power-of-waiting-your-turn-a-story-with-pili-and-pitzi.html" class="invert">The Power of Waiting Your Turn: A Story with Pili and Pitzi</a></h2></header><footer class="c-card__meta"></footer></div></div></article></div></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__left"><div class="footer__copy"><p>Powered by Publii</p></div></div><button onclick="backToTopFunction()" id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg><use xlink:href="https://hex20dec.github.io/piliandpitzi/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = { mobileMenuMode: 'sidebar', animationSpeed: 300, submenuWidth: 'auto', doubleClickTime: 500, mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus: true, relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector: '.navbar', };</script><script defer="defer" src="https://hex20dec.github.io/piliandpitzi/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=8190bbfcf662a6d5bf1ad35d88ad1ec9"></script><script>function publiiDetectLoadedImages () {
