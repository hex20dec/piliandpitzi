The animals were having so much fun that they didn't notice Pili and Pitzi approaching.</p><p>Pitzi said, "Excuse me, can we pass through? We don't want to interrupt your game."</p><p>One of the animals, a zebra, turned around and said, "Sure thing! We didn't even notice you were there."</p><p>Pili and Pitzi thanked the animals and continued on their way. They felt happy and respected because the animals took the time to notice them and let them through.</p><p>A little further down the path, they came across a sleeping lion. Pili and Pitzi needed to cross in front of him to get to the other side of the path.</p><p>Pitzi whispered to Pili, "How do we get past him without waking him up?"</p><p>Pili replied, "We should say 'Excuse me' in a soft voice and walk quietly so we don't disturb him."</p><p>Pitzi nodded and whispered, "Excuse me, Mr. Lion. We need to cross in front of you. Please excuse us."</p><p>The lion, still half-asleep, mumbled, "Sure, go ahead."</p><p>Pili and Pitzi tiptoed across, being careful not to wake the lion. They were relieved that they didn't have to disturb him and were able to pass through without any problems.</p><p>As they continued on their way, they saw many other animals who were in their way. Each time, they politely said "Excuse me" and asked if they could pass through.</p><p>By the end of the day, Pili and Pitzi had made many new friends and had shown everyone in the jungle the importance of being polite and respectful. They also learned that being respectful means not disturbing others, and that even if someone is sleeping, you should still say "Excuse me" before passing through.</p><p>The animals of the jungle were very impressed with Pili and Pitzi's manners, and they all decided to have a big feast to celebrate. Pili and Pitzi were very happy to have made so many new friends, and they were grateful for the lesson they had learned about being polite.</p><p>The end.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><footer class="post__footer"><div class="post__tag-share"><div class="post__share"></div></div></footer></div></article><div class="post__related"><h3 class="post__related__title">Related posts</h3><div class="l-grid l-grid--2"><article class="c-card"><div class="c-card__wrapper"><div class="c-card__content"><header><h2 class="c-card__title"><a href="https://hex20dec.github.io/piliandpitzi/pili-and-pitzis-jungle-adventure.html" class="invert">Pili and Pitzi&#x27;s Jungle Adventure</a></h2></header><footer class="c-card__meta"></footer></div></div></article><article class="c-card"><div class="c-card__wrapper"><div class="c-card__content"><header><h2 class="c-card__title"><a href="https://hex20dec.github.io/piliandpitzi/the-power-of-waiting-your-turn-a-story-with-pili-and-pitzi.html" class="invert">The Power of Waiting Your Turn: A Story with Pili and Pitzi</a></h2></header><footer class="c-card__meta"></footer></div></div></article></div></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__left"><div class="footer__copy"><p>Powered by Publii</p></div></div><button onclick="backToTopFunction()" id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg><use xlink:href="https://hex20dec.github.io/piliandpitzi/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = { mobileMenuMode: 'sidebar', animationSpeed: 300, submenuWidth: 'auto', doubleClickTime: 500, mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus: true, relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector: '.navbar', };</script><script defer="defer" src="https://hex20dec.github.io/piliandpitzi/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=8190bbfcf662a6d5bf1ad35d88ad1ec9"></script><script>function publiiDetectLoadedImages () {
