As they watched the monkeys leap from tree to tree, they noticed one of them struggling to climb up to a higher branch.</p><p>Pitzi immediately ran over to help the monkey, but as he got closer, he realized that the monkey was too high up for him to reach. He looked over at Pili, who had climbed higher into the trees.</p><p>“Pili, can you help the monkey get up there?” Pitzi called out.</p><p>Pili nodded and made her way over to the monkey. She helped him climb up to the higher branch, and the monkey chirped and chattered in gratitude.</p><p>As they continued their journey through the jungle, they came across a family of turtles trying to cross a muddy path. The mud was thick and sticky, and the turtles were struggling to make it through.</p><p>Pili and Pitzi quickly offered to help. They picked up the turtles one by one and carried them across the muddy path to the other side. The turtles looked up at them with grateful eyes and continued on their way.</p><p>Later that day, they came across a group of birds that were having trouble building their nests. The birds were flitting around, chirping loudly and looking quite distressed.</p><p>Pitzi and Pili immediately knew they had to help. They gathered sticks and leaves from around the jungle, and with the birds' guidance, helped them build their nests.</p><p>The birds flew around the newly built nests, chirping in joy and contentment.</p><p>As the sun began to set, Pili and Pitzi reflected on their day. They were happy that they were able to help the animals they had come across.</p><p>“Helping others feels really good,” Pili said.</p><p>“Yeah,” Pitzi agreed. “And it’s always good to give someone a hand when they need it.”</p><p>Pili and Pitzi continued their journey through the jungle, feeling proud of the kindness they had shown. They knew that helping others, whether animals or people, was always the right thing to do.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between"><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-3 md:gap-4 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible"> </div></div></div></div></div><div class="w-full h-32 md:h-48 flex-shrink-0">The End.</div></div></div></div></div></div><footer class="post__footer"><div class="post__tag-share"><div class="post__share"></div></div></footer></div></article><div class="post__related"><h3 class="post__related__title">Related posts</h3><div class="l-grid l-grid--2"><article class="c-card"><div class="c-card__wrapper"><div class="c-card__content"><header><h2 class="c-card__title"><a href="https://hex20dec.github.io/piliandpitzi/pili-and-pitzis-jungle-adventure.html" class="invert">Pili and Pitzi&#x27;s Jungle Adventure</a></h2></header><footer class="c-card__meta"></footer></div></div></article><article class="c-card"><div class="c-card__wrapper"><div class="c-card__content"><header><h2 class="c-card__title"><a href="https://hex20dec.github.io/piliandpitzi/the-power-of-waiting-your-turn-a-story-with-pili-and-pitzi.html" class="invert">The Power of Waiting Your Turn: A Story with Pili and Pitzi</a></h2></header><footer class="c-card__meta"></footer></div></div></article></div></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__left"><div class="footer__copy"><p>Powered by Publii</p></div></div><button onclick="backToTopFunction()" id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg><use xlink:href="https://hex20dec.github.io/piliandpitzi/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = { mobileMenuMode: 'sidebar', animationSpeed: 300, submenuWidth: 'auto', doubleClickTime: 500, mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus: true, relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector: '.navbar', };</script><script defer="defer" src="https://hex20dec.github.io/piliandpitzi/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=8190bbfcf662a6d5bf1ad35d88ad1ec9"></script><script>function publiiDetectLoadedImages () {
