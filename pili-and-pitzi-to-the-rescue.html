Suddenly, they heard a loud and frantic voice calling out their names. They looked up to see their friend, a little mouse named Mimi, running towards them.</p><p>Breathless and sweating, Mimi explained that she needed their help. Her burrow was flooded with water, and she needed to move her family to a new home. Pili and Pitzi were happy to help and followed Mimi to her burrow.</p><p>When they arrived, they found that the burrow was indeed flooded. Mimi's family was huddled together on a dry patch of earth, looking cold and miserable. Pili and Pitzi wasted no time in getting to work. They used sticks and leaves to make a makeshift dam, which diverted the water away from the burrow.</p><p>Next, they helped Mimi and her family move to a new home in a nearby tree. Pili and Pitzi carried the little mice, along with their belongings, and made sure that everyone was safe and dry.</p><p>As they were finishing up, Mimi's family thanked Pili and Pitzi for their help. "You are true friends," they said, "and we couldn't have done this without you."</p><p>Pili and Pitzi smiled, feeling proud of themselves for helping out. They knew that it was important to help others when they needed it, even if it meant putting their own plans aside.</p><p>Later that day, Pili and Pitzi were playing in the jungle when they saw a monkey struggling to climb a tree. They quickly ran over to help the monkey, and soon he was swinging effortlessly from branch to branch.</p><p>As they continued their day, Pili and Pitzi remembered the lesson they had learned. When someone asks for your help, do it graciously without complaint or grumbling. They realized that helping others was not only the right thing to do but also a way to spread kindness and make the world a better place.</p></div></div></div><div class="flex justify-between"><div class="text-gray-400 flex self-end lg:self-center justify-center mt-2 gap-3 md:gap-4 lg:gap-1 lg:absolute lg:top-0 lg:translate-x-full lg:right-0 lg:mt-0 lg:pl-2 visible">Â </div></div></div></div></div><div class="w-full h-32 md:h-48 flex-shrink-0">The End.</div></div><footer class="post__footer"><div class="post__tag-share"><div class="post__share"></div></div></footer></div></article><div class="post__related"><h3 class="post__related__title">Related posts</h3><div class="l-grid l-grid--2"><article class="c-card"><div class="c-card__wrapper"><div class="c-card__content"><header><h2 class="c-card__title"><a href="https://hex20dec.github.io/piliandpitzi/pili-and-pitzis-jungle-adventure.html" class="invert">Pili and Pitzi&#x27;s Jungle Adventure</a></h2></header><footer class="c-card__meta"></footer></div></div></article><article class="c-card"><div class="c-card__wrapper"><div class="c-card__content"><header><h2 class="c-card__title"><a href="https://hex20dec.github.io/piliandpitzi/the-power-of-waiting-your-turn-a-story-with-pili-and-pitzi.html" class="invert">The Power of Waiting Your Turn: A Story with Pili and Pitzi</a></h2></header><footer class="c-card__meta"></footer></div></div></article></div></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__left"><div class="footer__copy"><p>Powered by Publii</p></div></div><button onclick="backToTopFunction()" id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg><use xlink:href="https://hex20dec.github.io/piliandpitzi/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = { mobileMenuMode: 'sidebar', animationSpeed: 300, submenuWidth: 'auto', doubleClickTime: 500, mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus: true, relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector: '.navbar', };</script><script defer="defer" src="https://hex20dec.github.io/piliandpitzi/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=8190bbfcf662a6d5bf1ad35d88ad1ec9"></script><script>function publiiDetectLoadedImages () {
