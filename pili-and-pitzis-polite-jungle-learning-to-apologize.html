They ran around and giggled, chasing each other through the trees. Suddenly, Pili accidentally bumped into a sloth who was hanging from a tree branch.</p><p>"Oh no, I'm sorry!" Pili said, quickly apologizing to the sloth.</p><p>The sloth looked a bit startled at first, but then he smiled and replied, "No worries, Pili. Accidents happen. Thank you for saying sorry."</p><p>Pitzi, who had been following close behind Pili, saw what had happened and nudged her friend. "That was very kind of you to apologize, Pili," Pitzi said.</p><p>Pili smiled back at her friend and said, "I know how it feels to get bumped into, and it doesn't feel good. That's why it's important to apologize and make sure the other person is okay."</p><p>As Pili and Pitzi continued their game of tag, they made sure to watch where they were going and be careful not to bump into anyone else. But if they did accidentally bump into someone, they made sure to say sorry right away.</p><p>Later that day, Pili and Pitzi were walking through the jungle when they saw the sloth again. The sloth smiled and waved at them, and Pili and Pitzi waved back.</p><p>"Hey Sloth, how are you doing?" Pitzi asked.</p><p>"I'm doing great, thanks for asking," replied the sloth. "And how are you two doing?"</p><p>"We're doing great too," said Pili. "We just wanted to say sorry again for bumping into you earlier."</p><p>The sloth smiled and said, "That's okay, Pili. I appreciate your kindness. It's always important to be aware of others around us and show respect."</p><p>Pili and Pitzi nodded in agreement, and they all continued their walk through the jungle, chatting and enjoying each other's company.</p><p>From then on, Pili and Pitzi made sure to always apologize if they accidentally bumped into someone. They learned that showing kindness and respect is important in building strong and lasting relationships with others.</p><p>The end.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><footer class="post__footer"><div class="post__tag-share"><div class="post__share"></div></div></footer></div></article><div class="post__related"><h3 class="post__related__title">Related posts</h3><div class="l-grid l-grid--2"><article class="c-card"><div class="c-card__wrapper"><div class="c-card__content"><header><h2 class="c-card__title"><a href="https://hex20dec.github.io/piliandpitzi/pili-and-pitzis-jungle-adventure.html" class="invert">Pili and Pitzi&#x27;s Jungle Adventure</a></h2></header><footer class="c-card__meta"></footer></div></div></article><article class="c-card"><div class="c-card__wrapper"><div class="c-card__content"><header><h2 class="c-card__title"><a href="https://hex20dec.github.io/piliandpitzi/the-power-of-waiting-your-turn-a-story-with-pili-and-pitzi.html" class="invert">The Power of Waiting Your Turn: A Story with Pili and Pitzi</a></h2></header><footer class="c-card__meta"></footer></div></div></article></div></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__left"><div class="footer__copy"><p>Powered by Publii</p></div></div><button onclick="backToTopFunction()" id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg><use xlink:href="https://hex20dec.github.io/piliandpitzi/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = { mobileMenuMode: 'sidebar', animationSpeed: 300, submenuWidth: 'auto', doubleClickTime: 500, mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus: true, relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector: '.navbar', };</script><script defer="defer" src="https://hex20dec.github.io/piliandpitzi/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=8190bbfcf662a6d5bf1ad35d88ad1ec9"></script><script>function publiiDetectLoadedImages () {
