The feast was set up in a beautiful meadow, with a long table full of all sorts of delicious food.</p><p>As everyone gathered around the table, Pili and Pitzi noticed a big pot of stew that they didn't really like the look of. They wrinkled their noses and whispered to each other about how they didn't want to eat it.</p><p>Just then, their wise old friend, a turtle named Tilly, overheard them and said, "Now, now, Pili and Pitzi, don't make complaints or comments about food you don't like. It's not polite, and it might hurt someone's feelings."</p><p>Pili and Pitzi looked at each other, feeling ashamed. They realized that Tilly was right and that they should at least try the stew before deciding if they liked it or not.</p><p>Pitzi could see that Pili was hesitant to try the new dish, but she remembered a time when she had refused to eat something new, and then later found out that she actually liked it. Pitzi nudged Pili, whispering, "Remember that time we tried the new fruit in the jungle? We thought it looked weird, but it was delicious!"</p><p>So, they took a small spoonful each and tasted the stew. To their surprise, it was actually very delicious! They looked at each other and smiled, glad that they had listened to Tilly's wise words.</p><p>As the feast went on, Pili and Pitzi made sure not to make any more complaints or negative comments about the food. They even went out of their way to try some new dishes they had never tasted before.</p><p>By the end of the feast, Pili and Pitzi were so full and happy. They thanked their friends for the wonderful meal and felt grateful for the lesson they had learned. From that day on, they made sure to always approach new foods with an open mind and avoid making negative comments about them.</p><p>Â </p></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="w-full h-32 md:h-48 flex-shrink-0">The End.</div></div></div></div></div></div><footer class="post__footer"><div class="post__tag-share"><div class="post__share"></div></div></footer></div></article><div class="post__related"><h3 class="post__related__title">Related posts</h3><div class="l-grid l-grid--2"><article class="c-card"><div class="c-card__wrapper"><div class="c-card__content"><header><h2 class="c-card__title"><a href="https://hex20dec.github.io/piliandpitzi/pili-and-pitzis-jungle-adventure.html" class="invert">Pili and Pitzi&#x27;s Jungle Adventure</a></h2></header><footer class="c-card__meta"></footer></div></div></article><article class="c-card"><div class="c-card__wrapper"><div class="c-card__content"><header><h2 class="c-card__title"><a href="https://hex20dec.github.io/piliandpitzi/the-power-of-waiting-your-turn-a-story-with-pili-and-pitzi.html" class="invert">The Power of Waiting Your Turn: A Story with Pili and Pitzi</a></h2></header><footer class="c-card__meta"></footer></div></div></article></div></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__left"><div class="footer__copy"><p>Powered by Publii</p></div></div><button onclick="backToTopFunction()" id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg><use xlink:href="https://hex20dec.github.io/piliandpitzi/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = { mobileMenuMode: 'sidebar', animationSpeed: 300, submenuWidth: 'auto', doubleClickTime: 500, mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus: true, relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector: '.navbar', };</script><script defer="defer" src="https://hex20dec.github.io/piliandpitzi/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=8190bbfcf662a6d5bf1ad35d88ad1ec9"></script><script>function publiiDetectLoadedImages () {
